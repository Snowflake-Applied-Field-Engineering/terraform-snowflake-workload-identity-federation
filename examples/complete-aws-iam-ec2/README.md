# Example:

This example creates:

- An AWS IAM role + instance profile
- A Snowflake User and Role
- Configures WIF between the two
- Deploys an EC2 instance with the instance profile
- Creates a python script at `/opt/snowflake-test/_____TODO_____` that can be used to test WIF
-

TODO - update above for accuracy
